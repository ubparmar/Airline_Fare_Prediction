# Sky Vista Fare Prediction Project

## Predict Fare Prices with Machine Learning

> "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." - Eleanor Roosevelt

Welcome to the Sky Vista Fare Prediction Project! Our mission is to harness the power of machine learning to provide accurate fare price predictions, empowering travelers to make informed decisions and optimize their journeys.

## Project Website

Visit our project website [here](https://airline-fare-prediction.onrender.com/).

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
- **pip**: The Python package installer
- **Virtual Environment**: (optional but recommended)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ubparmar/Airline_Fare_Prediction.git
   cd repository-name

## Features

- Accurate prediction of airline fares using advanced machine learning algorithms
- User-friendly web interface for easy input and result visualization
- Support for multiple airlines and routes
- Historical data analysis for trend identification

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Flask/Django for web application framework
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend
- Git for version control

## Data

Our model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of historical flight prices, which includes:
- Date of journey
- Source and Destination
- Route information
- Airline
- Duration of flight
- Total stops

The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints. Please contact the project maintainers for access to the training data.

## Model

We use a Random Forest Regressor model, which has shown the best performance for our use case. The model is periodically retrained with updated data to ensure accuracy.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can use the prediction model through our web interface or via API:

1. Navigate to the home page
2. Input your flight details (date, source, destination, etc.)
3. Click "Predict" to see the estimated fare

For API usage, refer to our API documentation (link to be added).
